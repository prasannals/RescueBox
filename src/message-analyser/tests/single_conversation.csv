" [Message 1 - Ben]: I can't believe we pulled it off, Rach. The poison was perfectly lethal and undetectable.
   [Message 2 - Rachel]: Agreed, Ben. We were so careful, no one will suspect a thing.
   [Message 3 - Ben]: How did you feel when you saw the victim collapse?
   [Message 4 - Rachel]: It was unexpected, but I felt a strange sense of relief. We did it, Ben. We're free now.
   [Message 5 - Ben]: Free indeed. But we must stay vigilant, no loose ends.
   [Message 6 - Rachel]: Absolutely. Let's ensure we cover our tracks meticulously.
   [Message 7 - Ben]: Good idea. I'll start with the CCTV footage, see if there are any inconsistencies.
   [Message 8 - Rachel]: I'll clean up the lab and make sure no traces of the poison remain.
   [Message 9 - Ben]: Be careful, Rach. We don't want to draw attention.
   [Message 10 - Rachel]: Don't worry, Ben. I know what I'm doing.
   [Message 11 - Ben]: Alright. Let's reconvene tomorrow at the usual spot to discuss any findings.
   [Message 12 - Rachel]: Sounds good, Ben. See you then.
