1," [Message 1 - Ben]: I can't believe we pulled it off, Rach. The poison was perfectly lethal and undetectable.
   [Message 2 - Rachel]: Agreed, Ben. We were so careful, no one will suspect a thing.
   [Message 3 - Ben]: How did you feel when you saw the victim collapse?
   [Message 4 - Rachel]: It was unexpected, but I felt a strange sense of relief. We did it, Ben. We're free now.
   [Message 5 - Ben]: Free indeed. But we must stay vigilant, no loose ends.
   [Message 6 - Rachel]: Absolutely. Let's ensure we cover our tracks meticulously.
   [Message 7 - Ben]: Good idea. I'll start with the CCTV footage, see if there are any inconsistencies.
   [Message 8 - Rachel]: I'll clean up the lab and make sure no traces of the poison remain.
   [Message 9 - Ben]: Be careful, Rach. We don't want to draw attention.
   [Message 10 - Rachel]: Don't worry, Ben. I know what I'm doing.
   [Message 11 - Ben]: Alright. Let's reconvene tomorrow at the usual spot to discuss any findings.
   [Message 12 - Rachel]: Sounds good, Ben. See you then.",1,
2,"[Message 1] Marcus: Found anything good today?
[Message 2] Sarah: Not really. Just browsing. You?
[Message 3] Tom: Usual junk. Someone's gotta buy it, right?
[Message 4] Emily: Yeah, that's the flea market spirit.
[Message 5] Marcus: Saw some interesting... tech over by stall 42.
[Message 6] Sarah: Tech? Like what kind?
[Message 7] Tom: Old radios, probably. Or busted TVs.
[Message 8] Marcus: Maybe. Maybe not.
[Message 9] Emily: Depends on what you're looking for.
[Message 10] Sarah: Stall 42, huh? I might check that out.
[Message 11] Marcus: Don't say I didn't warn you.
[Message 12] Tom: What's that supposed to mean?
[Message 13] Marcus: Exactly what I said.
[Message 14] Emily: He's just being cryptic. Ignore him.
[Message 15] Sarah: Cryptic like...?
[Message 16] Marcus: Like, maybe the stuff isn't exactly... above board.
[Message 17] Tom: Now hold on a minute...
[Message 18] Emily: Tom, just... let it go.
[Message 19] Sarah: Above board in what way? Did you see something?
[Message 20] Marcus: I saw enough.
[Message 21] Emily: He probably just means it's overpriced.
[Message 22] Sarah: Maybe. But something feels off.
[Message 23] Tom: You always think something feels off, Sarah.
[Message 24] Marcus: Let her think what she wants.
[Message 25] Emily: So, anything else interesting today, besides Marcus's paranoia?
[Message 26] Tom: Found a cool vintage lighter. Nothing crazy.
[Message 27] Sarah: Lighters are cool. Practical, too.
[Message 28] Marcus: Practical for some things.
[Message 29] Emily: Marcus!
[Message 30] Tom: What's with you today? You on edge?
[Message 31] Marcus: Just... observant.
[Message 32] Sarah: Observant of...?
[Message 33] Marcus: Things. Events. Circumstances.
[Message 34] Emily: Right. Well, I'm going to get some coffee. Anyone want anything?
[Message 35] Tom: Black coffee for me, thanks.
[Message 36] Sarah: I'll come with you. Need to stretch my legs.
[Message 37] Marcus: Sounds good.
[Message 38] Emily: Okay, be back in a bit.
[Message 39] Sarah: Coming, Emily.
[Message 40] Marcus: (To Tom) So, you gonna ask?
[Message 41] Tom: Ask what? Don't play dumb.
[Message 42] Marcus: I'm not playing anything.
[Message 43] Tom: About stall 42. You know.
[Message 44] Marcus: Why would I know anything about stall 42?
[Message 45] Tom: Because you just implied... things.
[Message 46] Marcus: Maybe I was wrong. Maybe I saw things that weren't there.
[Message 47] Tom: Bull. You saw something. What?
[Message 48] Marcus: Just... some guys moving stuff. Quickly.
[Message 49] Tom: Moving what stuff?
[Message 50] Marcus: Doesn't matter. It's done.
[Message 51] Tom: Done how? Done what?
[Message 52] Marcus: Look, I don't want to talk about it, okay?
[Message 53] Tom: Fine. But if something shady went down...
[Message 54] Marcus: Just drop it, Tom. Seriously.
[Message 55] Emily: (Returning) Coffee's here!
[Message 56] Sarah: (Returning) Smells good.
[Message 57] Tom: Thanks, Emily.
[Message 58] Marcus: Appreciate it.
[Message 59] Emily: So, stall 42... still a mystery?
[Message 60] Marcus: Forget about it.
[Message 61] Sarah: Easy for you to say.
[Message 62] Tom: Yeah, some of us are curious.
[Message 63] Marcus: Curiosity killed the cat.
[Message 64] Emily: Okay, enough with the riddles.
[Message 65] Sarah: Did you say something about moving things fast?
[Message 66] Marcus: It was nothing. Really.
[Message 67] Tom: Yeah, just a couple of guys... unloading... something.
[Message 68] Emily: Sounds…normal?
[Message 69] Sarah: I don't know. I still feel like something happened.
[Message 70] Marcus: Look, I’ll handle the cleanup. Just… drop it.",2,
